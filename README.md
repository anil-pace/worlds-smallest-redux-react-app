# World's smallest Redux React app

## Background
Do you have learning Redux on your "Todo-list", and have had that for some time now? You have the feeling that you should be learning it but you never get around doing it? The Redux docs are pretty heavy and nothing you casually read through so it's a barrier for getting started.

I have set up a minimal React/Redux setup that you can run and experiment with today. It's a fun and easy starting point for learning Redux.

## Installation and Running

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jakoblind/worlds-smallest-redux-react-app.git
$ cd worlds-smallest-redux-react-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## How to read the code
There are only two files that's important: `src/App.js` and `src/index.js`. 

* `src/App.js` contains the React components and the Redux action (yes, it's only one!). 
* `src/index.js` contains the initial state, the reducer, the store.
